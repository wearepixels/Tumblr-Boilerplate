# WeArePixels | TUMBLR BASE TEMPLATE

Welcome to the We Are Pixels base template.
__NOTE : This is still very much a work in progress... use at own risk!__

We use [COMPASS](http://compass-style.org) and [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com) to get it done.We also have scraped a large part of this from [HTML5 BOILERPLATE](http://html5boilerplate.com).

### To get started go to your root directory in terminal and... 

		gem install compass
		compass watch

Then start editing style.scss and get into it. 

Rad!
